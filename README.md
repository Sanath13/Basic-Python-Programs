# Basic-Python-Programs

In this repository, I've added a couple of basic python programs which are made easier to understand, hopefully!

**1. Leap year:** 

**Condition:**

if year is divisible by 400 then is_leap_year

else if year is divisible by 100 then not_leap_year

else if year is divisible by 4 then is_leap_year

else not_leap_year
